2018-08-03T07:11:42.486Z - warn: Please change the definition of property 'scoreAudio' in class 'Game'. Starting from v1.10,
the use of declaring a property in CCClass as a URL has been deprecated.
For example, if property is Texture2D, the previous definition is:
    scoreAudio: cc.Texture2D,
    // or:
    scoreAudio: {
      url: cc.Texture2D,
      default: ""
    },
Now it should be changed to:
    scoreAudio: {
      type: cc.Texture2D, // use 'type:' to define Texture2D object directly
      default: null,      // object's default value is null
    },
(This helps us to successfully refactor all RawAssets at v2.0, sorry for the inconvenience. ðŸ˜° )
